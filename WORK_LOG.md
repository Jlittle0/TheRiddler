| Aug 22    |   8-8:30pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I started by thinking about my place in the universe.<br/>It was scary... |
| Aug 24-26 |   2+ hours    |                                                                                                         Thought about the fourth puzzle and tried to solve it in a variety of ways with information gathered via its UTF-8 code converted in binary, hex, and decimal but nothing worked. |
| Aug 27    |  10-10:30pm   |                                                                                                                                                                               I started working on writing the code to solve the first puzzle and completed it exccluding the apostrophe. |
| Aug 28    | 6:15 - 6:45am |                                                                                                            Nearly completed both the 2nd and 3rd puzzles with a few minor grammatical errors (such as there not being an extra space after comms) in 15 mins then thought about puzzle 4. |
| Aug 29    | 8:00 - 8:30pm |                                                                                                                                               Solved the fourth puzzler using information we learned in class and then worked on optimizing my three other solutions as much as possible. |
| Aug 30    |  7:30-8:00am  | Continued working on solution optimization, tried to learn about shifting and how it worked in java but with the limited amount of time wasn't able to complete it in a way that the puzzle was solved so I decided to revert back to the orginial solution I had that utilized parseInt. |
