| Aug 22    |   8-8:30pm    |                                                                                                         I started by thinking about my place in the universe.<br/>It was scary... |
| Aug 24-26 |   2+ hours    | Thought about the fourth puzzle and tried to solve it in a variety of ways with information gathered via its UTF-8 code converted in binary, hex, and decimal but nothing worked. |
| Aug 27    |  10-10:30pm   |                                                                       I started working on writing the code to solve the first puzzle and completed it exccluding the apostrophe. |
| Aug 28    | 6:15 - 6:45am |    Nearly completed both the 2nd and 3rd puzzles with a few minor grammatical errors (such as there not being an extra space after comms) in 15 mins then thought about puzzle 4. |
